## The reason I made this

Last night, my colleague and I had a great team building and after party. We were playing dice game in KTV. I was lose thousand time and drank a lot of beer. When I wake up today I trying to write some code to simulate the probability distribustion of this game.

## People with bad luck don't play this game with your friend. PROBABILITY WON'T SAVE YOU. :)

### Parameters:
- Nplayer: Number of people join the game
- Ndice: Dice number in each person's cup
- Round: The round of simulation'

Figure 4. We got a more smooth distribution if we have 10000 rounds simulation. But who cares......
